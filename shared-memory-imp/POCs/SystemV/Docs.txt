Compile Code :-
    Cpp:- g++ writer.cpp -o writer
    Python:- python3 reader.py

Creating shared memory,
    1. Key is important for all the program who is going to access
    2. Data size should be fixed. And other program should know the structure of the memory
        so program can extract.

This will only only with static data type means every data type should be fixed length 
and does not change on run time.
example :- 
    storing cpp string will make problem
    
    solution:- we have to store in memory like 
        {sizeOfString}{string}
    so that we can get how much data we have to read 

example:-
    struct
    {
        int a; //4 byte
        long b; //8 byte
        double c; //8 byte
        int sizeOfString; // store string s size 
        string s;  // dynamic
    }
